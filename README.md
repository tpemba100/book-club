# Book Share :books:

Book Share Now is a web application that allows users to keep track of their book lists. With Book Mates, users can log in and access their list of books that they have read, books that they are currently reading, and books that they want to read in the future. Users can also search for books online and add them to their list. Additionally, users can add notes to the books that they are currently reading, making it easy to keep track of important information.

<!-- Each book in the user's list has its own dataset, including comments from other users who have visited the user's profile and commented on their books, as well as notes and summaries. Other users can also add the user as a friend and view their book list, making it easy to share book recommendations and discover new titles. -->

With the MVP, our app lets users create accounts, add or delete books from their lists, search for books, view detailed book information, and add personal notes. It focuses on providing essential features for a seamless user experience.

## Features :rocket:

- Keep track of books that you have read, are currently reading, and want to read

- Search books online and add them to your list :mag_right:
  <!-- - View comments from other users on your books :speech_balloon: -->
  <!-- - Add friends and share book lists :busts_in_silhouette: -->
- Use a REST API for book search using Axios and Rest API :computer:
- Authentication: Utilizes CryptoJS to encrypt user passwords for secure registration and login, and manages authentication data using AuthContext.
- Share your bookList with everyone

## State Management and Authentication üîê
To manage the authentication and session state of the app, we used React's useContext in combination with localStorage. This approach ensures that the app persists the user's login state even after page reloads.
The authContext folder handles authentication by managing API requests, defining login/logout actions, providing global authentication state using useContext, and handling state changes based on dispatched actions.
This system ensures secure, efficient, and persistent user authentication, enhancing the user experience.
